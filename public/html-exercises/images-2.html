                    When I was a kid, I was a very curious child. I had a lot of questions in my mind that I had wanted to be answered immediately. 
                    The elders in our household used to tell us children that reading is important and that books are a great source of knowledge.
                    So to quench my thirst for knowledge, I had read a lot of books. Like a typical child, I love fairy tales, myths, legends,
                    and a lot of other fictitious stuff but I was also interested in science. My mother used to buy me a bunch of books including
                    an activity book with a lot of science experiments. Unfortunately, I've never tried any of those experiments because I did
                    not understand the instructions well (it was apparently for grade schoolers and I was just around 4 or 5years old that time). 
                    But the science books I've read gave me the idea that I wanted to become a scientist. I wanted to discover and create a lot of
                    things that the future will someday use.

                    Like any other kid who grew up and had experienced the harsh realities of life, I soon found out that I was stupid in Math and
                    was not that good with Chemistry. Thus, my dreams of becoming a scientist was <em>"shattered"</em>. My <em>"anguish"</em> for 
                    my shattered dream was short lived since I discovered that I was better at writing. I joined our school paper in high school and
                    was instantly promoted to Feature editor after a year. Back then, I had found my new passion.

                    I had thought that high school was harsh enough, but I soon found out that nothing compares to college. As soon as I entered 
                    college, I almost wanted to give up on writing. I discovered how tiring it was to think of different topics and to write as flawlessly
                    as possible every week. But unlike my dream of becoming a scientist, my being a writer is somewhat harder to let go. Although I'm going
                    through a lot of hardships now because of this, I still probably like it better than anything else. As of now, my only comfort in this
                    harsh college life is that I've had friends with me who, together, found new people we now treat as a sort of family.

                    I have always wanted to try travelling. My family never does so I'm quite itching to finish my studies and start doing whatever I want. 
                    Travelling is just a part of my plan. Together with my dream to become a writer, I want to see the world as it is and write something about 
                    it, not just the place but also the people. In a few years from now, I can see myself as a writer-slash-traveller who writes stories
                    about other people. I want to write stories that shows happiness, sadness, anger, and hope based on real people which will inspire everyone.
