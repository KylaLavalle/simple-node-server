            <h2>Behind the Facade</h2>
            <h4><em>Digging deeper into the personal profile of Kyla Lavalle</em></h4>
                <p>
                    Hi! My full name is <strong>Kyla Franchezka Mingay Lavalle</strong> but you can just call me <em>Kyla</em>.
                    I was born on the 18th of June 1994 in Ilaya, Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro.
                    I have a resting bitch face (most of the time) which I actually find as a sort of blessing because
                    I don't easily get approached to by people with bad intentions - and of course by normal people, which
                    is not that big of a deal for me since I'm more of an introvert that an extrovert (I find it quite taxing to chitchat with other people).
                    Although I look like a <em>kontrabida</em> queen, I actually am an otaku. I love fangirling over cute (and sometimes cool) stuff.
                    I love reading mangas and watching animes, though I tend to easily forget the names of most of the characters.

                    I took up my high school education in <abbr title= "Jose J. Leido Jr. Memorial National High School"> JJLJMNHS</abbr>, 
                    which is now known as <abbr title= "Oriental Mindoro National High School">OMNHS</abbr>. I am currently an undergraduate 
                    student here in <abbr title= "University of the Philippines Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>. I was quite addicted to reading when 
                    I was younger so I had read a lot of books, but like most people around my age, my favorite ones are <cite>Harry Potter</cite> by J.K. Rowling 
                    and the <cite>Percy Jackson Series</cite> by Rick Riordan. <strong>BUT</strong> unlike most people around my age, I also love 
                    <cite>Noli Me Tangere</cite> by Jose Rizal. I think there's no memorable quote to be found or heard in school because 
                    everyone's either too corny or <em>jeje</em> but I have always liked this quote which I heard in the movie <cite>Kung Fu Panda</cite>:
                    <blockquote>
                        Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery, but Today is a gift that is why it is called the Present.
                    </blockquote>
