                <h4><em>My Top 3 Book Picks</em></h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm not particularly a fan of movies and I'm more of a bookish person, so I'll just share my top favorite books:</p>
                    </p>
                        The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/418285.Noli_Me_Tangere_Touch_Me_Not_?from_search=true&search_version=service" target="_BLANK">
                        <cite>Noli Me Tangere</cite></a> by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. This Filipino literary canon depicts the life of the Filipinos during their colonization
                        under the Spanish regime. This book became my favorite during my third year in high school because it was really well-written and insightful.
                        It awakens the <em>"makabayan"</em> spirit in anyone who reads it seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next is the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107387-percy-jackson-the-olympians-boxed-set-the-complete-series-1-5?from_search=true&search_version=service" target="_BLANK">
                        <cite>Percy Jackson Series</cite></a> by  Rick Riordan. I love this book because I'm a fan of Greek myths and this book gives a modern, wholesome,
                        and funny twist to the sometimes morbid and immoral stories of the Greek gods and goddesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the top spot goes to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18362144-harry-potter?from_search=true&search_version=service" target="_BLANK">
                        <cite>Harry Potter Series</cite></a> by J.K. Rowling. Who wouldn't know the story of the orphaned boy who lived under the cupboard and is constantly 
                        maltreated by his aunt's family until he discovered that he was a wizard and is well-known in the Wizarding world as The-Boy-Who-Lived.
                        Rowling's take on the story reels you into the magical world and makes you want to believe in magic. Rowling's style is the best so far.

                <h4><em>The Top 3 Songs of my Playlist</em></h4>    
                    <p>
                        The third spot goes to  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejayqEKDAcs" target="_BLANK"><cite>Dati</cite></a> by Sam Concepcion. This song is relatable to the 
                        <em>90's</em> kids like me. Although I haven't experienced the lovey-dovey story depicted in the song, almost every part of the song stirs up childhood memories.
                        It is really relaxing and nostalgic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fMUYU8DC1U" target="_BLANK"><cite>Runaway</cite></a> by the Corrs. I like the sound of it. It is relaxing and well, sweet. 
                        It makes me want to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, my top spot goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu5TlSXEzzs" target="_BLANK"><cite>Canon and Gigue in D major</cite></a>. It was originally composed by
                        Johann Pachelbel around the 18th century as a chamber music and has now evolved into a classical piece with many versions. I know most people see classical
                        music as a sort of lullaby, but for me it's not. As like the other two, this piece is relaxing and it is my favorite because it helps me think and focus. 
                        Although I say it is relaxing, the tempo and beat of the music sends a surge of excitement within me, thus preventing me from falling asleep and staying out of focus.
                        A good listening material for hell week and cramming nights.
