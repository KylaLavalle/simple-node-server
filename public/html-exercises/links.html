                <h4><em>My Top 3 Book Picks</em></h4>
                    <p>I'm not particularly a fan of movies and I'm more of a bookish person 
                    so I'll just share my top favorite books.</p>
                    <p>
                        The third spot goes to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/418285.Noli_Me_Tangere_Touch_Me_Not_?from_search=true&search_version=service">
                        <cite>Noli Me Tangere</cite></a> by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. This Filipino literary canon depicts the life of the Filipinos during their colonization
                        under the Spanish regime. This book became my favorite during my third year in high school because it was really well-written and insightful.
                        It awakens the <em>"makabayan"</em> spirit in anyone who reads it seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next is the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107387-percy-jackson-the-olympians-boxed-set-the-complete-series-1-5?from_search=true&search_version=service">
                        <cite>Percy Jackson Series</cite></a> by  Rick Riordan. I love this book because I'm a fan of Greek myths and this book gives a modern, wholesome,
                        and funny twist to the sometimes morbid and immoral stories of the Greek gods and goddesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the top spot goes to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18362144-harry-potter?from_search=true&search_version=service">
                        <cite>Harry Potter Series</cite></a> by J.K. Rowling. This is my ultimate favorite book! Who wouldn't know the story of the orphaned boy who lived under the
                        cupboard and is constantly maltreated by his aunt's family until he discovered that he was a wizard and is well-known in the Wizarding world as the Boy-Who-Lived.
                        Rowling's take on the story reels you into the magical world and makes you want to believe in magic.
